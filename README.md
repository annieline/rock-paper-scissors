# rock-paper-scissors

A classic game of RPS (following The Odin Project) with cute graphics made by me :)

This is made using HTML/CSS/Javascript and I learned alot about the DOM, calling functions and event listeners.

Future improvements:
+ add a "fight" visual to reflect the most recent match
+ add CSS hover animations to the button and change images
